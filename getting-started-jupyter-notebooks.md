# Getting started with Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks are commonly used for interactive Python computing. 

Jupyter notebooks are installed automatically if you installed Anaconda [(see here)](getting-started-python.md).

To use a Jupyter notebook with your `msds534` virtual environment:
1. Open Terminal
2. Run the command `conda activate msds534`
3. Run the command `jupyter notebook`
