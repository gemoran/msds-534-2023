# Rutgers MSDS-534 (Fall 2023)

Welcome to MSDS-534! Here we will share computing resources for the class.

## Getting started with Python

1. Install Python and get started with environments [(guide)](getting-started-python.md).
2. Create a Jupyter Notebook [(guide)](getting-started-jupyter-notebooks.md)

### Other good Python IDEs (integrated development environments)
- PyCharm (download [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download) -- scroll down for free Community Edition)
- VSCode (download [here](https://code.visualstudio.com))

Personally, I (Gemma) prefer PyCharm as it is similar-ish to R Studio and has good project management. Specifically, you can create a project and specify what environment you want to use for that project. Whenever you open that project, your Python console will automatically be using that environment. 

(Let us know if you have other favorite Python IDEs we should add here!)

## Learning Python

### Introduction
A good introduction to Python for data science is from _Introduction to Statistical Learning_, (James, G., Witten, D., Hastie, T., and Tibshirani, R.)

Here is a nice blogpost about learning Python as an R user:

### PyTorch
This is a nice introduction to PyTorch -- it starts with a basic linear model and shows you how to code it up in PyTorch (saving the bells and whistles of neural networks for another time)

## Lecture Notebooks

Here we will post Jupyter Notebooks from the lectures.
