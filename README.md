# Rutgers MSDS-534 (Fall 2023)

Welcome to MSDS-534! Here we will share computing resources for the class.

## Getting started with Python

1. Install Python and get started with environments [(guide)](getting-started-python.md).
2. Download VSCode (download [here](https://code.visualstudio.com))
3. Download [Lecture 1](lectures/lecture-1/lecture-1.ipynb) and open it in VSCode
4. To use your `msds534` environment, on the top right hand corner, click "Select Kernel" > "Python Environments" > `msds534`. If it prompts you to install `ipykernel`, follow the prompts to install it.
5. See if you can run [Lecture 1](lectures/lecture-1/lecture-1.ipynb)!

### Other good Python IDEs (integrated development environments)
- PyCharm (download [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download) -- scroll down for free Community Edition). Note there is no Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb` files) in community PyCharm.

## Learning Python

### Introduction
A good introduction to Python for data science is from _Introduction to Statistical Learning_, (James, G., Witten, D., Hastie, T., and Tibshirani, R.)
- https://github.com/intro-stat-learning/ISLP_labs/blob/stable/Ch02-statlearn-lab.ipynb

Here is a nice blogpost about learning Python as an R user:

### PyTorch
This is a nice introduction to PyTorch -- it starts with a basic linear model and shows you how to code it up in PyTorch (saving the bells and whistles of neural networks for another time)

## Lecture Notebooks

Here we will post Jupyter Notebooks from the lectures.
