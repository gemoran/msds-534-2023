# Rutgers MSDS-534 (Fall 2023)

Welcome to MSDS-534! Here we will share computing resources for the class.

## Getting started with Python

1. How to install Python and get started with environments [here](getting-started-python.md).

Common options for using Python include:
- Jupyter Notebooks [instructions here](getting-started-jupyter-notebooks.md)
- PyCharm (download [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download) -- scroll down for free Community Edition)
- VSCode (download [here](https://code.visualstudio.com))

Personally, I (Gemma) prefer PyCharm as it is similar-ish to R Studio and has good project management. Specifically, you can create a project and specify what environment you want to use for that project. Whenever you open that project, your Python console will automatically be using that environment. 

(Let us know if you have other favorite Python IDEs we should add here!)

### Learning Python

A good introduction to Python for data science is:
- Section 2.3 (Lab: Introduction to Python), _Introduction to Statistical Learning_, James, G., Witten, D., Hastie, T., and Tibshirani, R.

## Lecture Notebooks

Here we will post Jupyter Notebooks from the lectures.

- [Lecture 1](lectures/lecture-1.ipynb)



## Other guides (under construction)

- Using github
