# Getting started with Python

## Installation

Download Anaconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download).

(Note: there are a variety of different python distributions; for statistics and machine learning, we recommend Anaconda.)

## Managing packages

Similar to `R`, there are many open source Python packages for statistics and machine learning.

To download packages, two popular package managers are `pip` and `conda`.  Both `pip` and `conda` come with the Anaconda distribution. 

## Environments

We recommend using virtual environments with Python. From [this blog](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/a-complete-guide-to-python-virtual-environments/):

> A Python virtual environment consists of two essential components: the Python interpreter that the virtual environment runs on and a folder containing third-party libraries installed in the virtual environment. These virtual environments are isolated from the other virtual environments, which means any changes on dependencies installed in a virtual environment donâ€™t affect the dependencies of the other virtual environments or the system-wide libraries. Thus, we can create multiple virtual environments with different Python versions, plus different libraries or the same libraries in different versions.
